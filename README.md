# Curious George Memory Game
This fun, interactive game is based on the PBS kids' show "Curious George" and created with React JS.  The user is given 15 different images, each based on a character from the show. Each time the user clicks an image, the 15 images randomly rearrange, and the user must remember which characters have already been clicked.  If the user accidentally clicks a previously-clicked image, the game restarts.  The navbar keeps track of the topscore and the amount of correct clicks.
